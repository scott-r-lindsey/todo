This is just Scott learning Laravel, with React as a front end.

# Requirements
 - Docker
 - PHP (Any recent PHP version)
 - Composer

This will install dependecies for Laravel and React.

The application will appear on http://localhost:8081/

# TODO
- PHP is dockerized, node is not.  I should really choose one strategy
